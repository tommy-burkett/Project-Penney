    "\n",
    "- For a standard 52-card deck, compute the probability of winning/losing/drawing for player 2\n",
    "    - Compare probabilities if scoring by totals cards vs tricks\n",
    "    - Look at all 64-8=56 possible games (minus the 8 ways for players to choose the same sequence)\n",
    "    - Present the results in a heatmap\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Want results to be easily reproducible and verifiable\n",
    "    - I.e, we want to generate random decks, but will also need to store the seeds\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Want to be able to easily debug/test things\n",
    "    - I.e., if some of our numbers look suspect, be able to run a quick match of e.g, 1000 games.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Want to make it easy to augment the existing data, for example, add an additional million random decks without having to start all the way from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As much as possible, be efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage."
